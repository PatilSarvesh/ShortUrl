## Usage

### Creating Short URLs

To create a short URL, send a POST request to the `/api/url` endpoint with the long URL in the request body. The API will return the generated short URL.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://example.com/very-long-url"}' http://localhost:5000/api/url
```
### Resolving Short URLs

To resolve a short URL and get the original long URL, send a GET request to the short URL. The API will redirect you to the original long URL.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -L http://localhost:5000/abc123
```
